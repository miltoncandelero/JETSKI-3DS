#JETSKI 3DS

**JETSKI 3DS** is an unofficial game for nintendo 3DS made during GGJ 2017. It runs in the implementation of the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) API for 3DS Homebrew, LovePotion.

### Can I compile this myself?

Technically, maybe.

Try following the [LovePotion guide](https://github.com/VideahGams/LovePotion/wiki/Building-L%C3%96VEPotion) and pray that the make gods are on your side.
